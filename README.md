# Windows Wallpapers

Ever look at your lockscreen and feel that you want to use that as your wallpaper? Just clone this repository and run the python script.

```sh
# dependencies
$ pip install Pillow

# clone this repository and change directory
$ git clone https://github.com/deepakhr1999/windows_wallpapers && cd windows_wallpapers

# run the script
$ python main.py
```

This will create 2 folders (if they dont exist): images and mobile in this directory. Both will have 1080p jpg images.

##### Note
-   Works only for windows computers
-   I am not sure about computers without 1080p displays.
